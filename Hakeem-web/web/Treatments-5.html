								<h5>Hyperthyroidism</h5>
								
								<p>Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces Thyroid hormone in excess. This hormone controls the every aspect of metabolism in the body, controls the body temperature, helps in protein synthesis, produces a hormone calcitonin that normalize the quantity of calcium in the blood and assists in the growth and consumption of oxygen in the cells. Overactive thyroid increases the BMR (body's metabolism rate). This leads to sudden weight loss, rapid heartbeat and excessive sweating.<br></p>

								<h5>Hypothyroidism</h5>
								
								<p>Thyroid gland is one of the most important and sensitive endocrine gland. As it easily responds to stress and stimuli the global incidence of hypothyroidism is increasing day by day. The major function of thyroid gland is to control the rate of metabolism. The principle function of thyroxine is to act as a catalyst –of the nature of a ''spark'' for the maintenance of oxidative metabolism in most tissues. Cells in the body take their "cue" from thyroxine.  The amount of stimulation the cells receive from thyroxine will determine how "quickly" they perform their functions. These functions similar with the description of agni “angati vyapnoti iti va agnihi” and “agnyate mreeyate iti va agnihi”.

Hypothyroidism results from inadequate production of thyroid hormone. Any structural or functional defects of thyroid gland that significantly impairs its output of hormones will lead to the hypo metabolic state of hypothyroidism.</p>

								<h5>I B S</h5>
								
								<p>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is also known as Irritable colon. It is a gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorder for which there is no organic or structural cause.

The disease condition is called Grahani, which indicates the pathological state of function and integrity of the intestinal tract (mostly small intestine), a particular part of the GI system known as grahani in Sanskrit.Grahani is the seat of enzymes (agni). Normally, it holds up the food (until it is digested) and releases it from the side after it is digested. But when it is deranged due to weak digestive enzymes, it releases the ingested material even in undigested conditions.</p>

								<h5>Insomnia</h5>
								
								<p>Ayurvedic name for Insomnia (Sleeplessness) is Anidra. It is a condition in which a person is unable to take proper rest. The patient is unable to sleep properly and this affects his daily activities.

One of the reasons that insomnia is on the rise is the high stress levels and time pressures associated with modern living. The people would gladly get more sleep if they could, but the information age, which was supposed to make everything more efficient, has just made everything busier. Many people complain of insomnia, with stress during the day making them too tense or worried to be able to fall asleep at night. Lack of sleep, in turn, creates more stress on the job and at home. However, it is important to know at the outset that not all people require the same amount of sleep. Sleeping cycles vary among people and throughout a person’s life.

The common areas affected are face, hand,feet, axilla, groins and trunk. The areas which are subjected to friction and trauma are usually involved; and any damage to skin leaves to white depigmented scar.Vitiligo in Ayurvedic literatures is described as 'SHVITRA' or "Shveta Kusth", while classifying Kusth in its eighteen main types.

								<h5>Liver Disorders</h5>
								
								<p>The liver is the largest glandular organ in the body, and has more functions than any other human organ. A person's entire blood supply passes through the liver several times a day, and at any given time there is about a pint of blood there.
The Liver has a pivotal role in human metabolism.

The liver produces and secretes bile (to be stored in the gallbladder until needed) that is used to break down and digest fatty acids.
It also produces prothrombin and fibrinogen, both blood-clotting factors, and heparin, a mucopolysaccharide sulfuric acid ester that helps keep blood from clotting within the circulatory system.</p>
